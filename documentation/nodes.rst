.. _addingNewNodes :

Defining new node types
///////////////////////

Conedy provides nodes with the dynamics of ordinary differential equations, stochastic differential equations, iterated maps, and pulse-coupled oscillators.
The dynamics of these systems can be assessed by a common interface, which easily allows to investigate the same network endowed with different dynamical systems as node dynamics.

See :ref:`nodes` for a full list of available node dynamics.

Each node dynamics is described in an INI-like description files, which is explained in the following.
If the dynamics you want to investigate is not available in Conedy, you still may implement it yourself by creating such a file, which has to be stored in a directory which is specified in the ``config.h`` file (which is positioned in ``$HOME/.config/conedy`` by the ``.deb``-package).
Conedy needs to be recompiled afterwards, which will be automatically issued on the next import to python if a file in this directory is modified or added.

In the following the syntax for such a file will be explained using the Rössler oscillator as an example (available as :ref:`roessler` in Conedy).
Before delving into the details we give the file’s full content for the sake of an overview:

.. code-block:: c++

	[roessler]

	parameter = 4
	parametername1 = omega
	defaultvalue1 = 0.89
	parametername2 = a
	defaultvalue2 = 0.165
	parametername3 = b
	defaultvalue3 = 0.2
	parametername4 = c
	defaultvalue4 = 10.0

	type = ode

	dimension = 3
	dynamics =
		dxdt[0] = -omega*x[1] - x[2] + couplingSum() - weightSum()*x[0];
		dxdt[1] = x[0] + a*x[1];
		dxdt[2] = b() + x[2] * (x[0]-c);


Name
----

Begin with the name of the desired dynamics, enclosed in square brackets::

   [roessler]

The name should not match with a previously defined node and be a valid python token. For example, it should not begin with a number.


Parameters
----------
Specify the number of parameters of the node::

	parameter = 4

Specify a name and a default value for each parameter::

	parametername1 = omega
	defaultvalue1 = 0.89
	parametername2 = a
	defaultvalue2 = 0.165
	parametername3 = b
	defaultvalue3 = 0.2
	parametername4 = c
	defaultvalue4 = 10.0

.. _dynamicsEquations :

Equations
---------
The Rössler oscillator is described by ordinary differential equations. We thus specify::

   type = ode

Dynamical systems of this by default be integrated with routines from the GSL. See the :ref:`next subsection <integrators>` for a detailed description. Next, specify the number of dynamical variables of the node (e.g. the number of differential equations)::

	dimension = 3

Finally the dynamics of the system has to be defined. The exact syntax of this part depends on the type of the dynamical system. For the ``ode`` type, the time derivatives of each dynamical variable have to be specified:

.. code-block:: c++

	dynamics =
		dxdt[0] = -omega*x[1] - x[2] + couplingSum() - weightSum()*x[0];
		dxdt[1] = x[0] + a*x[1];
		dxdt[2] = b + x[2] * (x[0]-c);

Note that the indenting of every line after the first is mandatory here. The equations are directly copied into a C++ file and may contain the following elements:

-	standard C constructs like basic mathematical operators, brackets or loops
-	functions from ``math.h``
-	the parameters of the dynamics as variables, e.g. ``omega``
-	the dynamical variables such as ``x[0]``
-	``weightSum()`` which returns the sum over the weights (``weight``) of the incoming edges.
-	``couplingSum()`` which returns the sum over the ``weight`` × ``state`` as supplied by the incoming edges. For most edge types, ``state`` is the current value of the first dynamical variable of the connected node.
-	the macro ``forEachEdge`` which provides a loop over all incoming edges. In such a loop ``weight`` returns the weight of the respective edge and ``state`` returns the state. For example the first equation of the above Rössler oscillator might as well have been defined by:

	.. code-block:: c++

		dxdt[0] = -omega()*x[1] - x[2];
		forEachEdge(
			dxdt[0] += weight*state - weight*x[0];
		)

	For an example, which requires the use of ``forEachEdge``, see the :ref:`Kuramoto oscillator <kuramoto>`.

For more information on ``weight`` and ``state``, see :ref:`edges`.

.. _integrators :

Integrators
-----------

Conedy offers integrators for dynamical systems of the following types:

Maps (``map``)
``````````````

Iteration of a map. The ``dynamics`` field should define the next state ``xprime`` directly as function of the current state ``x``.

Example:

.. code-block:: c++

	dynamics =
	xprime[0] = r * x[0] * (-x[0] + 1)

.. _odenodes :

Ordinary differential equations (``ode``)
`````````````````````````````````````````

The ``dynamics`` field should define the derivative ``dxdt`` as function of the current state ``x`` (an example was already given above). Numerical integration algorithms are provided by the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). At the moment only those algorithms are supported, which do not use the Jacobian. In the Python script a specific stepping function can be choosen by setting ``odeStepType`` to one of the following values:

- ``"gsl_rk2"``
- ``"gsl_rk4"``
- ``"gsl_rkf45"``
- ``"gsl_rkck"``
- ``"gsl_rk8pd"``
- ``"gsl_rk2imp"``
- ``"gsl_rk4imp"``

Example::

	co.set("odeStepType", "gsl_rkf45")

See the `the GSL’s documentation`_ for specific information.

.. _odeprec :

Adjusting precision and step size
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

With all these schemes, the step size adapts such that the estimated error of integration for each :math:`x_i` is lower than :math:`\texttt{odeAbsError} + \texttt{odeRelError} \cdot x_i`, where ``odeAbsError`` and ``odeRelError`` are accessible parameters.
``odeAbsError`` defaults to 0.0, ``odeRelError`` defaults to :math:`10^{-5}`.
The step size can be accessed as the parameter ``odeStepSize``, whose initial value is 0.001 and which is the only global parameter, Conedy changes by itself.
It only resets, if manually changed with Conedy’s ``set`` command.
In any case, a step will never go beyond the next *event*, i.e. the end of the time evolution or the next automatic snapshot (controlled by the parameter ``samplingTime``, see :ref:`evolving`).
Because of this, changing the ``samplingTime`` will slightly affect the results of the integration, which in turn may have large consequences when integrating a chaotic system.

If the parameter ``odeIsAdaptive`` is set to ``False``, the step size does not adapt but is fixed to a value that is very close to ``odeStepSize`` for most realistic applications.
(In this case, Conedy does not change the parameter ``odeStepSize``.)
To be precise, the actual step size is the largest value, that (a) is at most marginally greater than the parameter ``odeStepSize`` and (b) allows for the time until the next event to be evenly divided into steps.
As long as ``odeStepSize`` is small in comparison to ``samplingTime`` (see :ref:`evolving`) and the total evolution time, the actual step size differs very little from ``odeStepSize``.
If you use GSL 1.15, or higher, the error margin defined by ``odeAbsError`` and ``odeRelError`` is still in effect, however, if the estimated error exceeds this margin, an error is issued (instead of adapting the step size).
Again, ``samplingTime`` slightly influences the step size and thus the results of the integration.

For example, the following commands will issue a time evolution, where the step size starts at 0.1 and is then dynamically adjusted, such that the estimated integration error for each dynamical variable is one per mill of the value of this variable.
However, the step size will never exceed 10.0 or the time left until the next event.
After the evolution, the current, adapted step size is printed (and is most likely not 0.1):

.. testcode::

	co.set("odeAbsError", 0.0)
	co.set("odeRelError", 0.001)
	co.set("odeStepSize", 0.1)
	co.set("samplingTime", 10.0)
	N.evolve(0.0, 100.0)
	print co.get("odeStepSize")

If ``co.set("odeIsAdaptive", True)`` is issued in the beginning, the step size will be fixed to 0.1 (or to a marginally smaller value) and integration will fail if the estimated integration error of any variable exceeds one per mill of the value of this variable.


.. _sdenodes :

Stochastic differential equations (``sde``)
```````````````````````````````````````````

.. math::
   dx = a(x,t)  dt + s(x,t) dW

The ``dynamics`` field should define ``dxdt`` for the deterministic part and ``s`` for the stochastic part. For multiplicative noise and when using the Milstein integrator ``dsdx`` (= :math:`\frac{ds(x.t)}{dx}`) has to be defined as well.

Example (with ``drift`` and ``diffusion`` being parameters):

.. code-block:: c++

	dynamics =
	dxdt[0] = -drift*x[0] + couplingSum();
	s[0] = diffusion;

The integrator can be chosen by setting ``sdeStepType`` to one of these values

-  ``euler``
-  ``milsteinIto``
-  ``milsteinStrato``

Example:

.. code-block:: c++

   co.set("stdSdeIntegrator_stepType", "milsteinIto")


.. _pulse-coupled:

Pulse-coupled oscillators (``pco``)
```````````````````````````````````

The state of a pulse-coupled oscillator is completely defined by its phase :math:`\phi \in [0,1]`, which has a linear time evolution :math:`\frac{d\phi}{dt} = 1`. Whenever the phase of an oscillators reaches 1, the oscillator `fires`, i.e. its phase is reset to 0 and the phase of every oscillator to which an edge is directed from the firing oscillator is influenced. The influence on an oscillator is defined by its phase-response curve :math:`\Delta(\phi)`:

.. math::
   \phi' = \phi + \Delta(\phi)

The integration of these oscillators is handled by an event-based approach and is excact (as far as admitted by double precision).  To define the node dynamics, the ``dynamics`` field should define the change ``delta`` (i.e.  :math:`\Delta(\phi)`) of the phase of the current node (the phase response curve).

Example:

.. code-block:: c++

	delta = a() +  b() * phase;

You may use the same elements as for the definition of differential equations. ``weightSum()``, ``couplingSum()`` and ``forEachEdge`` will, however, refer to outgoing instead of incoming edges and be of little use either way. Additionally the current phase of the node is provided as ``phase``—changes of this variable are, however, without effect. Also the weight of the edge which mediated the pulse is given as ``coupling``.

If a pulse sets a node’s phase to a value greater than 1.0, this node also fires, but the excess phase remains. E.g., a node with a phase of 1.4 fires and its phase is set to 0.4 afterwards. If you wish the phase to be reset to 0.0 in this case, you can implement this in the ``dynamics`` field:

.. code-block:: c++

	delta =  a() +  b() * phase;

	if (delta + phase > 1)
		delta = 1 - phase;

Now, if the phase is about to be set to a value larger than 1.0, it is set to 1.0 instead.


Pulse-coupled oscillators with delay (``pcoDelay``)
```````````````````````````````````````````````````

Similar as ``pco``, however each outgoing pulse is delayed by a time given by the parameter ``timeDelay``. (Each node dynamics based on ``pcoDelay`` automatically has ``[nodeType]_timeDelay``  as first parameter.)


Using static edges
------------------

When considering networks with different kinds of edges connecting to a single node, the type of each edge has to be determined individually at run-time. In Conedy this is realized by virtual functions. For networks which homogeneous edge types, however, this may be unneccessarily slow. Furthermore, the vtables of edges may consume a significant amount of memory.

Conedy offers the possiblility of making node types static, i.e. the type of outgoing edge (for ``ode``, ``sde``, and ``map``) or incoming edge (for ``pco`` and ``pcoDelay``), respectively is set at compile time. For these nodes, no virtual function calls have to be made during integration. For cases with many unweighted edges, this reduces the memory consumption of static nodes on 64 bit machines by a factor of 4 (compared to virtual nodes). This is because for virtual nodes, in addition to the target node number (4 byte) and the vtable (8 byte), most compilers will leave another 4 bytes unused due to alignment.

.. Conedy’s standard way of implementing edges are virtual functions,
.. which consume a certain amount of memory for the needed vtable. In addition whenever a node during numerical integration requires the state of a connected node, virtual function calls have to be made, which may be unneccessarily slow—depending on the circumstances.

To use static edges add::

   staticEdges = 1

to the description file for your node. Additionally the edge type which should be associated with your node has to be defined in the following way::

   staticEdgeType = weightedEdge

Optionally you can choose a node type for target nodes (for example, if all nodes in your network are of the same type), which eliminates another virtual function call::

   staticTargetNodeType = roessler

You can add outgoing edges to such a node as usual, however the result will always be the predefined static edge. Also weighted static edges are still affected by ``randomizeWeights``.

The following table shows memory usage in bytes of basic edges in Conedy on a 64 bit architecture.
