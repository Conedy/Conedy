Tutorial
////////


This tutorial aims at giving you a short impression of Conedy’s features and making you familiar with its working principle.

We examplarily generate a small-world network of coupled Rössler oscillators with dynamical Gaussian noise, choose parameters and initial conditions and write the results of numerical integration of the dynamics to a file. The Rössler oscillator is one of the standard toy models included in Conedy.


.. Knowledge of its mechanisms is not required for the understanding of any of the examples.

.. In the following examples the Roessler oscillator will appear as a node type.


Before we begin, we have to import Conedy to Python.

.. testcode:: TUT

	import conedy as co

(If not stated otherwise, Conedy is assumed to have been imported like this throughout this manual.)




Selecting node dynamics
-----------------------

First we specify the dynamics we want to consider

.. testcleanup:: TUT

   N.clean()


.. testcode:: TUT

   nodeTemplate = co.gaussianRoessler(0.89, 0.165, 0.2, 10.0, 0.1)

``nodeTemplate`` now points to a Rössler oscillator with dynamical Gaussian noise, which Conedy will integrate with an Euler-Maruyama scheme by default. The parameters of the template are set by the arguments of ``gaussianRoessler``. (Details of the node dynamics and the parameters are described in :ref:`gaussianRoessler`.)

Conedy ships with a few  pre-defined node dynamics (see :ref:`nodes`). In addition, it allows you to incorporate arbitrary dynamics by writing a small specification file, which mainly contains a differential equation (see :ref:`addingNewNodes`).



.. _tutorialNetworkCreation :

Creating a network
------------------
We want to create a `small-world`_ network which is based on a closed chain of 100 nodes, where each node is connected to its 4 nearest neighbors on each side. Subsequently, 10 percent of all connections are replaced by connections with random source and target nodes

.. testcode:: TUT

   N = co.network()
   N.cycle(100, 4, nodeTemplate, co.weightedEdge(0.1))
   N.rewireUndirected(0.1)

Note that if the network ``N`` already contains nodes, the ``cycle`` method will add a set of circularly connected nodes without affecting the existing ones.

In order to verify the network’s topology, you can calculate measures like the mean shortest path length or the mean clustering coefficient:

.. testcode:: TUT

	print "clustering coefficient:" + str (N.meanClustering())
	print "mean path length:" + str (N.meanPathLength())

.. testoutput:: TUT
      :hide:
      :options:    +ELLIPSIS

      clustering coefficient:...
      mean path length:...

See :ref:`edgesAndNetworks` for more information on network creation, manipulation and analysis.

Randomizing initial conditions and node parameters
--------------------------------------------------

Until now all oscillators in our network are identical. The following commands change this by picking the initial state randomly from [–0.1, 0.1] for all components. Aditionally the parameter ``gaussianRoessler_omega`` (the oscillator's eigenfrequency), which we have not touched yet, is picked randomly from [0.8, 1.2] for each oscillator


.. testcode:: TUT

	N.randomizeStates(nodeTemplate,co.uniform(-0.1,0.1),co.uniform(-0.1,0.1),co.uniform (-0.1,0.1))
	N.randomizeParameter( "gaussianRoessler_omega", co.uniform(0.8,1.2) )




Evolving and observing a network
--------------------------------

Next we tell Conedy that we want to evolve the time from t = 0.0 to t = 100.0 in order to let transients die out. The dynamical states will thus be integrated by a numerical integration (and we intentionally do not observe them)

.. testcode:: TUT

   N.evolve(0.0, 100.0)

After this we want the integration time and the z-component (component 2 in zero-based enumeration) of all 100 oscillators be written to a file every Δt = 0.01.

.. testcode:: TUT

   N.observeTime("output_Roessler")
   N.observeAll("output_Roessler", co.component(2))
   co.set("samplingTime", 0.01)

During a second calling of ``evolve``, Conedy will compute the time series of the 100 Rössler oscillators. For each time step, the time and the z-component of all oscillators will be written to the file ``output_Roessler``.

.. testcode:: TUT

   N.evolve(100.0, 200.0)

Note that in our example the absolute time values only affect the time which is saved to the file. Since the oscillator dynamics do not depend on absolute time, their time evolution would not have been affected, if we had used ``N.evolve(0.0, 100.0)`` instead.

See :ref:`observeDynamics` for a list of commands in Conedy, which involve numerical integration of the created networks.
